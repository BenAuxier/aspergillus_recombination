These files can be used to reproduce the QTL mapping shown in Figure 3 of the manuscript to map resistance to the antifungal acriflavine. The asp_June9_pheno.csv file contains resistance phenotyping data for grown on nitrate, nitrite, and hypothanxine, as well as growth on 25ug/mL acriflavine, sporulation on 25ug/mL acriflavine, and growth on 50 and 100ug/mL acriflavine. Growth on 50ug/mL acriflavine was the phenotype used for the resistance mapping.

NOTE: for size considerations, the file asp_June9_geno.csv is found in the folder for Figure 1, as it is used there as well.
